I'm Achieving power
That I know I've never felt before
I will never cower
Even when I'm bloodied on the floor
Hour after hour
I'm training and I won't break a sweat
Take a breath
We all know what's gonna happen next
Breaking the Ceiling
Impossible feeling
I'm messing you up of you're messing with krillin
Not killing but dealing with enemies
Telling me "better be ready"
They gotta be kidding
I'm beating up Frieza an arrogant cheater
A creature who's thinking he could be a leader
Defeat em' and leave em' I'm ever so eager
But after I'm famished, a bottomless eater
Hit em' with a Super Saiyan flow
Quicker when I flicker
Split a villain than I go, oh
Android or alien foes
I will be breaking their bones with the force from my blows
Don't need no dragon balls to grant me power
That's just me
I'll blast you outta my planet
You'll need a senzu bean
5, seconds til it's over
Take it to another level
4, punches to the body
Now that you're wanting to wrestle
3, and I'm in it
2,I will bring it
1, feel the power
As I'm breaking through my limits
I can, feel it
Through the ceiling
I will win it, breaking limits
See my spirit, in a minute
This is finished,breaking limits
Yeah, I'm breaking limits
Yeah, I'm breaking limits
I know they fear us, I'm a god like beerus
Ain't no body messing with Goku when he is serious
Hearin this, this isn't Super Saiyan I've gone beyond
Call it Ultra Instinct and the fight is done
Dimension I'm hopping, I will not be stopping
Until I've defeated my foes,ay
Bodies they dropping,you will not be topping
The ki that will flow through my bones, ay
Z warriors flooring your followers now I'm about to ascend
Get Whis to turn back time, so I can beat you again
Strongest in the galaxy
Happy, you wanna battle me?
Flashy I'm hitting rapidly
Classy not taking casualties
Actually I do it casually,wondering how I got this far
Show you with my final move
Kame,Hame,Ha
Seconds til it's over, take it to another level
4,punches to the body, now that you're wanting to wrestle
3,and I'm in it 2,I will bring it
1 feel the power as I'm breaking through my limits
I can, feel it, through the ceiling, I will win it, breaking limits
See my spirit, in a minute, this is finished, breaking limits
Yeah, I'm breaking limits
Yeah, I'm breaking limits
